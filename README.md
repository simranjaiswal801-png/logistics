## 🔍 Project Overview
Live Demo: https://simranjaiswal801-png.github.io/logistics/
Most accounting software is generic and does not fully address the operational needs of logistics companies.  
This project redesigns the accounting UI to align with **real-world logistics workflows**, such as:

- Shipment-based invoicing  
- Vehicle-wise expense tracking  
- Fuel and toll management  
- Route-wise revenue and profit analysis  

The goal is to demonstrate **design thinking + front-end implementation** for an industry-specific use case.
